Problem Statement : Given a number N, find the Nth term in the series 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21,...
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution {
  public:
    int findNthTerm(int N) {
        if(N==1)
            return 1;
        else 
            return N+findNthTerm(N-1);
    }
};
Explanation : The nth term in the given series 1,3,6,10,... is obtained by adding n to the previous term.
We use recursion to solve this problem where if n = 1, 1 is returned (base case) else (n + findNthTerm(n-1)) is returned.
