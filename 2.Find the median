Problem statement : Given an array arr[] of N integers, calculate the median.
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution
{
public:
	public:
		int find_median(vector<int> v)
		{
		    sort(v.begin(),v.end());
		    int n=v.size();
		    if(n%2==0)
		        return (v[n/2]+v[n/2-1])/2;
		    else
		        return v[n/2];
		}
};
Explanation : Median for a given list of observations is the middle most value.
Firstly we sort the given vector using inbuilt sort function.
The size of the vector is found using size() method.
If number of observations is even, the mean of middle most observetions is considered else, the middle most observetion is returned.
