Problem Statement : Given three integers P,R and T, denoting Principal, Rate of Interest and Time period respectively.Compute the simple Interest.
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution {
  public:
    double simpleInterest(int P, int R, int T) {
        return double(P*R*T)/100;
    }
};
Explanation : The simple interest is calculated using the formula (P*R*T)/100, which is calculated and returned.
