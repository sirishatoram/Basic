Problem Statement : Swap given two numbers and print them. (Try to do it without a temporary variable.) and return it.
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution{   
public:
    pair<int, int> get(int a, int b){
        pair<int,int> PAIR(b,a);
        return PAIR;
        
    }
};
Explanation : Here, we use a pair of both elements with integer datatype. 
To swap the given elements, during initialisation of the pair the swapped values are assigned to them and returned.
