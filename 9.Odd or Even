Problem Statement : Given a positive integer N, determine whether it is odd or even.
Solution (C++) :
class Solution{   
public:
    string oddEven(int N){
        if(N%2==0)
            return "even";
        else
            return "odd";
    }
};
Explanation : Any natural number is said to be even, if it is leaves a remainder 0 when divided by two, else odd.
The '%' operator is used to find the remainder when divided by a number.
If the given number(N) leaves remainder 0 when divided by 2, then it is "even", else "odd".
