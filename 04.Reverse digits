Problem Statement : You are given an integer N, reverse the digits of given number N, ensuring that the reversed number has no leading zeroes. Return the resulting reversed number.
Solution (C++) :
class Solution
{
	public:
		long long int reverse_digit(long long int n)
		{
		    long long int rev=0;
		    int a;
		    while(n>0)
		    {
		        a=n%10;
		        rev=rev*10 +a;
		        n=n/10;
		    }
		    return rev;
		}
};
Explanation : To reverse the given number(n) , we use a while loop till n > 0. 
Then inside the loop, the last digit is obtained by '%' operator and it is added to a variable rev each time multiplying it by 10. Initially rev=0 and then n is updated to n/10 
Finally rev is returned.
