Problem Statement : Given a stream of incoming numbers, find average or mean of the stream at every point.
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution{
public:	
	vector<float> streamAvg(int arr[], int n) {
	    vector<float> avg;
	    float sum=0;
	    for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	    {
	        sum+=arr[i-1];
	        avg.push_back(float(sum/i));
	    }
	    return avg;
	}
};
Explanation : To find the average of elements in the given array(arr) of n elements at each point, a floating varaiable sum and a vector avg are declared.
We use a for loop which iterates for n times where in each iteration the sum of the elements upto that point is calculated by adding each element to sum which is initially 0.
Then using sum, we calculate the mean upto those elements and add the result to vector avg, using push_back() method.
Finally, the vector avg is returned.
