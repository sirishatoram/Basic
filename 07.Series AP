Problem Statement : Given the first 2 terms a1 and a2 of an Arithmetic Series.Find the nth term of the series.
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution {
  public:
    int nthTermOfAP(int a1, int a2, int n) {
      int an;
      an=a1+(n-1)*(a2-a1);
      return an;
    }
};
Explanation : In an Arthimetic Progression (AP), the difference between any two terms is same.
We use the formula a+(n-1)*(a2-a1) to find the nth term, where a1,a2 are first two terms of the progression.
The result is stored in an and returned.
