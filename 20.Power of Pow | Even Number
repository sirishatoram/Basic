Problem Statement : Given a single integer N, your task is to find the sum of the square of the first N even natural Numbers.
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution
{
	public:
		long long int sum_of_square_evenNumbers(long long int n)
		{
		    long long int sum = 2*n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/3;
		    return sum;
		}
};
Explanation : We use the formula 2*n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/3 to find the sum of the squares of the first N even natural numbers.
This formula is obtained from the formula n*(n+1)*(2*n+1)/3, which is to find the sum of the squares of the first N natural numbers.
The result is calculated and then returned.
