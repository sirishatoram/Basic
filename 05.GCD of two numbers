Problem Statement : Given two positive integers a and b, find GCD of a and b.
                    Note: Don't use the inbuilt gcd function.
Solution (C++) : 
class Solution {
  public:
    int gcd(int a, int b) {
        int temp;
        while(b>0)
        {
            temp=b;
            b=a%b;
            a=temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
};
Explanation : To find the Greatest Common Divisor(gcd) of two numbers (a,b) we use a while loop until b > 0 where the value of b is stored in a temporary variable and its value is updated to a%b.
Then the value in the temporary variable is updated to a.
When becomes 0, the value at a becomes the gcd of the two numbers.
