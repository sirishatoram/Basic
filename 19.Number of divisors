Problem Statement : Given an integer N, find the number of divisors of N that are divisible by 3.
Solution (C++) :
class Solution
{
	public:
		int count_divisors(int n)
		{
		    int count=0;
		    for(int i=1;i*i<=n;i++)
		    {
		        if(n%i==0)
		        {
		            if(i%3==0)
		                count++;
		            if((n/i)%3==0 && n!=i*i)
		                count++;
		        }
		    }
		    return count;
		}
};
Explanation : To count the divisors of given number(n) which are also divisible by 3, we use a variable count which keeps a count of them and is initialized to 0.
We use a for loop which runs from i=1 till i*i<=n where half of the factors of n are present.
'%' operator is used to find if a number is a divisor of n and 3.If yes, then count is incremented twice as i and (n/i) are factors.
If i and (n/i) are same i.e when the given number is a perfect square, the count is incremented only once.
At the end, the count is returned.
